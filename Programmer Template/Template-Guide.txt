Welcome to the RSX 2025 programmer template guide!

To use the template properly (and to keep things organized!) do the following:

1) Make sure you have your own branch (preferably title it with your name).
2) Copy this folder and push it into your branch (not someone else's!).
3) Place ALL of YOUR code inside of your folder and push to YOUR branch when ready.
4) If you believe you are ready to merge your code into higher branch, check in with the team leads.
5) Thank you for your hard work!
